   <p>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.  Fruit of the spirit simply describes oneâ€™s  character that can be observed by others.</p>
   <p>The wonderful truth about the Christian life is we are all on a progressive journey. Each of us demonstrates the fruit of the Spirit differently and will grow at different rates. Jesus was perfect in all of His dealings and interactions with others. Who else better to coach you than thr Son of God Himself. Today, let Christ be your coach.</p>
   <p>This self-assessment is meant to help you learn more about yourself and which Christ character trait you can start earning points toward on your Behavior Report Card.</p>
